•	How does the CAP Theorem play a role in designing for the cloud?

CAP theorem logic is meant to allow a distributed system to deliver two of the three desired characteristics:
1.	Consistency
2.	Availability
3.	Partition Tolerance 

As all cloud applications are distributed systems, it is essential to have a solid understanding of the CAP theorem when designing a cloud application for us to choose a data management system that delivers the characteristics our application needs the most.

•	What are the implications of Amdahl’s law for Machine Learning projects?

Amdahl’s law is a theoretical approach in assessing the benefit of parallelization. There is a formula to measure the speedup of running sub-tasks in parallel versus running them sequentially.
Speedup factor compared to the Number of cores is available online in pictorial form that gives a high-level overview of “Speedup according to Amdahl’s law”. What is important to consider is that not every program can be effectively parallelized.

•	Post a screenshot of a lab where you had difficulty with a concept or learned something.

I have not had a chance to get to the lab part yet.
